# restaurant-market-research
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course to maser data visualization.

For visualization in this project we use Seaborn library and interactive Plotly plots.

Project description: 

As an analyst in a team that's about to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles we're going to conduct a research based on open-source data on restaurants in LA. The goal of the research is to analyze the current market conditions and present the results to potential investors, which will help them to decide whether this business will be able to maintain success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off.
